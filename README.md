# PythonMiniProjects

This repository contains several mini python projects this practice questions can also be used for practice purposes.

#### Problem 1: 
Write a programme to accept a number from user and return the reverse of the number without using the reverse function.

#### Problem 2:
Write a programme to accept a number from the user and return the sum of all the natural number that are the multiples of Five and Seven.

#### Problem 3:
An Array has been sorted in ascending order but has been cyclically shifted, find the element that has to the minimum element. Write an algorithm that optimally finds the minimum element in such an array.

#### Problem 4:
Check if a palindrome can be created by the string provided by the user, print "True" if the word is a palindrome and "False" if it is not a palindrome.

#### Problem 5:
Write a function to determine whether one line is a permutation of another and print the result. Write an algorithm that optimally finishes the task.

#### Problem 6:
Given a line, the words in it are indicated with a space,  print words in descending order of their length.

#### Problem 7:
Write a function, which counts each character in a string and print the output with the character count.

#### Problem 8:
Fill the water into all the bottles. Some are already full, while some are empty and some are partially filled. Each bottle can contain X milliliters of water 
(Dynamic, entered by user), while the capacity of Jar is 1 litre. Ana array (Given by user) is given with the existing bottles on the tables, with 0 to 10 as the values for each element, where 0 means its empty and 10 means its full. Fill all the bottles and print how much additional water was used to fill all the bottle. Come up with am optimal algorithm and implement it. Use least amount of varaible and statements, but performance matters.
