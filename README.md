# PythonMiniProjects

This repository contains several mini python projects. This questions can also be used for practice purpose please feel free to try them out.

#### Problem 1:
Write a programme to accept a number from user and return the reverse of the number without using the reverse function.

#### Problem 2:
Write a programme to accept a number from the user and return the sum of all the natural number that are the multiples of Five and Seven.

#### Problem 3:
An Array has been sorted in ascending order but has been cyclically shifted, find the element that has to the minimum element. Write an algorithm that optimally finds the minimum element in such an array.

#### Problem 4:
Check if a palindrome can be created by the string provided by the user, print "True" if the word is a palindrome and "False" if it is not a palindrome.

#### Problem 5:
Write a function to determine whether one line is a permutation of another and print the result. Write an algorithm that optimally finishes the task.

#### Problem 6:
Given a line, the words in it are indicated with a space,  print words in descending order of their length.

#### Problem 7:
Write a function, which counts each character in a string and print the output with the character count.

#### Problem 8:
Fill the water into all the bottles. Some are already full, while some are empty and some are partially filled. Each bottle can contain X milliliters of water 
(Dynamic, entered by user), while the capacity of Jar is 1 litre. Ana array (Given by user) is given with the existing bottles on the tables, with 0 to 10 as the values for each element, where 0 means its empty and 10 means its full. Fill all the bottles and print how much additional water was used to fill all the bottle. Come up with am optimal algorithm and implement it. Use least amount of varaible and statements, but performance matters.

#### Problem 9:
Given a numercial array. Check if there are two such number in the array, multiplying which we get given number X.

#### Problem 10:
You are a hardworking child but you lack sleep cause of being busy with work you can only sleep when you are off working days or you are on holidays. You have to create a programme that you get to sleep (Return TRUE) if you are on holidays or you are off from wokring days.

#### Problem 10:
You are a hard working child but you lack sleep cause of being busy with work. You can only sleep when you are off working day or you are on holidays, You hav to create a programme that you get to sleep when you are on holidays or you are off from working day. return True when you get to sleep and False on the working days.

#### Problem 11:
Their is a pair of twin children, Ash, Bob and bothm of them has parameters a_happy and b_happy. It becomes too confusing to identify them when they are in same mood. It becomes too confusing to identify them when they are in the same mood, So you have to create a programme to give result False when they are in te same mood and True when not.

#### Problem 12:
You have to create a programme which returns sum of the given two input values but if given values are same then return double of their sum.

#### Problem 13:
We all use the function to convert a string to a number but what if that was not available. This task is to write your own convert to string function.
  1. A string contains alphanumeric characters, but the function should be able to pick the last set of digits.
  2. It should only convert the sring to intergarss and if the decimals are provided, they shoould be rounded off to a nearest integar.
  3. The range of this number should be between [-2^31,2^31-1]. If the result is outside this range, display the border value.
