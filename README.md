# PythonMiniProjects

This repository contains several mini python projects this practice questions can also be used for practice purposes.

#### Problem 1: 
Write a programme to accept a number from user and return the reverse of the number without using the reverse function.

#### Problem 2:
Write a programme to accept a number from the user and return the sum of all the natural number that are the multiples of Five and Seven.

#### Problem 3:
An Array has been Sorted in ascending order but has been cyclically shifted, find the element that has to the minimum element. Write an algorithm that optimally finds the minimum element in such an array.

#### Problem 4:
Check if a palindrome can be created by the string provided by the user, print "True" if the word is a palindrome and "False" if it is not a palindrome.

#### Problem 5:
Write a function to determine whether one line is a permutation of another and print the result. Write an algorithm that optimally finishes the task.
