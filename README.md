# PythonMiniProjects

This repository contains several mini python projects. This questions are also for practice purposes. Please feel free to try them out. Please try using logic instead of predefined functions.

#### Problem 1:
Write a programme to accept a number from user and return the reverse of the number without using the predefined reverse() function.

#### Problem 2:
Write a programme to accept a number from the user and return the sum of all the natural number that are the multiples of either 5 or 7 or both of them.

#### Problem 3:
An Array has been sorted in ascending order but has been cyclically shifted, find the element that has to the minimum element. Write an algorithm that optimally finds the minimum element in such an array.

#### Problem 4:
Check if a palindrome can be created by the string provided by the user, print "True" if the word is a palindrome and "False" if it is not a palindrome.

#### Problem 5:
Write a function to determine whether one line is a permutation of another and print the result. Write an algorithm that optimally finishes the task.

#### Problem 6:
Given a line, the words in it are indicated with a space, print words in descending order of their length.

#### Problem 7:
Write a function, which counts each character in a string and print the output with the character count.

#### Problem 8:
Fill the water into all the bottles. Some are already full, while some are empty and some are partially filled. Each bottle can contain X milliliters of water 
(Dynamic, entered by user), while the capacity of Jar is 1 litre. Ana array (Given by user) is given with the existing bottles on the tables, with 0 to 10 as the values for each element, where 0 means its empty and 10 means its full. Fill all the bottles and print how much additional water was used to fill all the bottle. Come up with am optimal algorithm and implement it. Use least amount of varaible and statements, but performance matters.

#### Problem 9:
Given a numercial array. Check if there are two such number in the array, multiplying which we get given number X.

#### Problem 10:
You are a hard working child but you lack sleep cause of being busy with work. You can only sleep when you are off working day or you are on holidays, You have to create a programme that you get to sleep when you are on holidays or you are off from working day. Return "True" when you get to sleep and "False" on the working days.

#### Problem 11:
Their is a pair of twin children, Ash, Bob and bothm of them has parameters a_happy and b_happy. It becomes too confusing to identify them when they are in same mood. It becomes too confusing to identify them when they are in the same mood, So you have to create a programme to give result "False" when they are in the same mood and "True" when not.

#### Problem 12:
You have to create a programme which returns sum of the given two input values but if given values are same then return double of their sum.

#### Problem 13:
We all use the function to convert a string to a number but what if that was not available. This task is to write your own convert to string function.
  1. A string contains alphanumeric characters, but the function should be able to pick the last set of digits.
  2. It should only convert the sring to intergarss and if the decimals are provided, they should be rounded off to a nearest integar.
  3. The range of this number should be between [-2^31,2^31-1]. If the result is outside this range, display the border value.
  
#### Problem 14:
Write a programme which inputs two numbers A and B. If A is smaller than B then print absolute difference else print double of their absolute difference.

#### Problem 15:
YOu have a pet cat and whenever it cries between time 7 to 20, you are safe.
The input has to be given in whether the cat is crying (Input "True") or not (Input "False") and time in form of "Hour" in range 0 to 23.
So create a programme to check whether you are safe (Output "True") or not (Output "False").

#### Problem 16:
You have to create a programme where you have to print first 3 letters of a given word three times. if the given input is less than 3 than print it 3 times as well.

#### Problem 17:
You have to print a programme in which a given string is printed with first and last letter exchanged.

#### Problem 18:
You have to create a programme which takes input as two arguments where one will be string and the other a positive int. Now you to print output first three characters of the given string the times the value is given as input.
